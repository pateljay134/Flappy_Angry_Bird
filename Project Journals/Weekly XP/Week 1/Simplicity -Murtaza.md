### XP Core Value - Simplicity

Simplicity is that principle of XP which makes all the things simple in the project progress and not predicting tomorrow’s needs. It means to take small, simple steps towards the goal and mitigating issues on the fly.

- In our first team meeting, we have discussed multiple game engines and have prioritized on the most efficient platform. As a result, we have decided to develop a user-friendly application using simple methods and implementations.

- Together we will judge our code subjectively using TUBE (Testable, Understandable, Browser, Understandable) qualities.
